# 🧠 Breast Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the detection of breast cancer using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
It was developed as a **group project** within the scope of an **Artificial Intelligence course**.

The goal is to build a deep learning model capable of classifying breast tissue images as **benign** or **malignant**, supporting early diagnosis and decision-making processes in healthcare.

The project is implemented and experimented using **Google Colab** and shared via **GitHub** for reproducibility and transparency.
